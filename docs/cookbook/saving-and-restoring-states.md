# Saving and Restoring States

## Using Home Assistant scene creation

Home Assistant added the ability to create scenes on the fly. This has reduced
the work needed to be done in Node-RED to be able to restore entities to a
previous state.

Here are several examples using the get-entities node to get the states of
several entities and then how to restore the entity states.

As you can see in the above examples the `switch` and `light` domains are just saving and restoring the state, on/off. But what if some users wanted to also save and restore the brightness level or not. The `climate` domain is saving and restoring more than just the state.
