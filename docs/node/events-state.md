## Changelog

#### Version 1

- "if state"/"halt if" will now send the message to the first output if true and
  to the second if not. The old behavior, sending the message to the second
  output if true will continue to be in place until you edit one of the
  existing nodes via the UI and at that time the outputs will automatically be
  switched.
